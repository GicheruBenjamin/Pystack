## Description

Stacks are a fundamental data structure in computer science that follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Here are some key characteristics and uses of stacks:

LIFO: The Last-In-First-Out principle means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. This is similar to a stack of plates, where you can only add or remove plates from the top of the stack.
Operations: Stacks typically support three main operations: push (add an element to the top of the stack), pop (remove and return the top element), and peek (return the top element without removing it).
Uses: Stacks have various applications in computer science, including:
Expression evaluation and syntax parsing: Stacks are used in the evaluation of arithmetic expressions and the parsing of programming language syntax.
Backtracking and depth-first search: Stacks are used in algorithms that require backtracking, such as depth-first search in graphs and tree traversal.
Function call stack: In programming languages, the function call stack is used to manage the execution of function calls and return addresses.
Undo/redo functionality: Stacks can be used to implement undo/redo functionality in applications, where each operation is pushed onto the stack and can be popped off to undo the operation.
Implementation: Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. Array-based implementations are simple and efficient for accessing elements, but they have a fixed size and may require resizing. Linked list-based implementations are more flexible in terms of size but may be less efficient for accessing elements.
Space complexity: The space complexity of a stack is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the stack. This is because each element in the stack requires a constant amount of space.
Stacks are a versatile data structure with many applications in computer science and programming. Understanding how to use and implement stacks is an important skill for any programmer.
